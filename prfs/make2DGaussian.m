function [img] = make2DGaussian(ih,iw, sd);% function [img] = make2DGaussian(ih,iw, sd);%% Function makes a circular Gaussian, centered in the window%% ih = image height, iw = image width (in pixels)% sd = standard deviation of Gaussian (in pixel units) %% created by Frank Tong on 2006/03/28% modified/ simplified from makeGaussMaskCircle.m on Aug 2014[x,y]=meshgrid([(1:iw)-(iw/2)], [(1:ih)-(ih/2)]);	% make a 2-D grid of x,y positionseccen = sqrt((x).^2+(y).^2); 	% calculate eccentricity of each point in grid relative to center of 2D image	img = exp(-eccen.^2/(2*sd^2)) *1/(sd^2*(2*pi));  % set area under Gaussian to equal 1% Formula for 1D gaussian with max=1, min=0, is y = exp(-(x-mean)^2/(2*sd^2))% assume mean = 0, then it follows that:% img = exp(-eccen.^2/(2*sd^2));
